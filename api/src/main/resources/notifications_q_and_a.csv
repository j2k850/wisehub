Mention what are the various steps in an analytics project?:Problem definition:Data exploration:Data preparation:Modelling:Validation of data:Implementation and tracking
List out some of the best practices for data cleaning?:Sort data by different attributes:For large datasets cleanse it stepwise and improve the data with each step until you achieve a good data quality:For large datasets, break them into small data. Working with less data will increase your iteration speed:To handle common cleansing task create a set of utility functions/tools/scripts. It might include, remapping values based on a CSV file or SQL database or, regex search-and-replace, blanking out all values that don’t match a regex:If you have an issue with data cleanliness, arrange them by estimated frequency and attack the most common problems:Analyze the summary statistics for each column ( standard deviation, mean, number of missing values,
List of some best tools that can be useful for data-analysis?:Tableau:RapidMiner:OpenRefine:KNIME:Google Search Operators:Solver:NodeXL:io:Wolfram Alpha’s:Google Fusion tables
List out some common problems faced by data analyst?:Common misspelling:Duplicate entries:Missing values:Illegal values:Varying value representations:Identifying overlapping data
Mention what are the missing patterns that are generally observed?:Missing completely at random:Missing at random:Missing that depends on the missing value itself:Missing that depends on unobserved input variable
Explain what should be done with suspected or missing data?:Prepare a validation report that gives information of all suspected data. It should give information like validation criteria that it failed and the date and time of occurrence:Experience personnel should examine the suspicious data to determine their acceptability:Invalid data should be assigned and replaced with a validation code:To work on missing data use the best analysis strategy like deletion method, single imputation methods, model based methods, etc
Explain what is an Outlier?:Univariate:Multivariate
